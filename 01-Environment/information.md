# VS Code vs Visual Studio – What's the Difference?

As a new C# developer, you might notice there are two different apps with similar names:

---

## 🟩 Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

**This is what we're using in this workshop.**

### ✅ Why?
- Lightweight and fast
- Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- Easy to install and configure
- Perfect for beginners learning C#
- Great for working with Git, Markdown, and terminal

---

## 🟪 Visual Studio (Purple Icon)

This is the full **Visual Studio IDE** — a heavy-duty development environment.

### Best for:
- Game development with Unity
- Windows desktop applications
- Enterprise software

### But:
- It's big (5–8 GB)
- Windows-focused
- Overkill for simple console apps

## 🤔 So Why Use VS Code for This Course?

You're learning:
- Basic C# syntax
- Logic and structure
- How to use the terminal and Git

VS Code is the best tool for that — it's light, modern, and beginner-friendly.

## 🕹️ What About Unity?

Unity installs **Visual Studio (purple)** by default for script editing.

You can also use VS Code with Unity — it just takes a little setup. Both editors write the same C# code, you're just changing where you write it.
