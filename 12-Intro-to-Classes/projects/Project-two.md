# Project â€“ RPG Character Creator

## ðŸ§  Goal:
Build a basic RPG-style character creator using classes and object instances.

---

## ðŸ”§ Instructions:
1. Create a class `Character` with fields:
   - `Name`, `ClassType`, `Health`, `AttackPower`
2. Add a method `DisplayStats()` that prints the characterâ€™s details
3. In `Main`, create 2â€“3 different characters with different values

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Output:
```
Name: Kaia
Class: Warrior
Health: 120
Attack: 30
```

---

## âœ… Bonus Challenges:
- Add a constructor that auto-assigns starting stats based on `ClassType` (e.g., Warrior vs Mage)
- Add a method `Attack()` that prints an attack message
- Create a static method to compare two characters' attack power

---

## ðŸ›  How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o RPGCharacterCreator
cd RPGCharacterCreator
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
