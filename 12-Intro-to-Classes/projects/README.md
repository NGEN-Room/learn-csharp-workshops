# Project – Book Info App

## 🧠 Goal:
Create a program that stores and displays information about a book using a class.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Define a `Book` class with fields for `Title`, `Author`, and `Pages`
2. Add a method `PrintInfo()` that prints out those details
3. Create at least 2 books and call their `PrintInfo()` method

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Title: The Hobbit
Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
Pages: 310
```

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Use a constructor to set values
- Store books in a list and loop through them
