# Project – Username Generator

## 🧠 Goal:
Create a username generator that builds a unique name from user input.

## 🔧 Requirements:
1. Ask the user for their first and last name
2. Combine them into a lowercase username with a random number at the end
3. Display the generated username

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Enter your first name:
> Piha
Enter your last name:
> Thompson
Generated username: pthompson47
```

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Truncate names to first initial + full last name
- Add current year or timestamp to username
