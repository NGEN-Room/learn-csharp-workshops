# Project – Reference Behavior Tester

## 🧠 Goal:
Explore the difference between value and reference types in code.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Create one example using a value type (`int`) and a reference type (`array`)
2. Assign each to a second variable
3. Modify the second and print the first
4. Add a method that uses `ref` to change a value

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Add a helper method that returns two values using `out`
- Make it interactive and ask the user to choose which demo to run

## 🛠️ How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o RefVsValue
cd RefVsValue
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
