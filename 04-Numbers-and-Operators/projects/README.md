# Project ‚Äì Simple Calculator

## üß† Goal:
Build a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic on two numbers.

## üîß Requirements:
1. Ask the user for two numbers
2. Ask them to choose an operation: +, -, *, /, %
3. Display the result

## üß™ Example Output:
```
Enter first number:
> 10
Enter second number:
> 3
Choose operation (+, -, *, /, %):
> /
Result: 3.33
```

## ‚úÖ Bonus Challenge:
- Support floating point numbers (e.g. use `double`)
- Handle divide-by-zero with an error message
- Loop the calculator so it runs multiple times until user types `exit`

Create a new console app with:
```bash
dotnet new console -o SimpleCalculator
