# 🛠️ How To Use Projects in This Course

Each workshop module contains **project-based learning** designed to help you apply what you just learned.

---

## 📦 Create a Project Folder

At the end of each module, you’ll find a `projects` folder with at least one project idea.

Every time you start a new project, create a new console app from scratch using this command:

```bash
dotnet new console -o YourProjectName
```

✅ Replace `YourProjectName` with something relevant to the module or your project (e.g. `CharacterProfile`, `MathGame`, `GradeCalculator`).

This creates a self-contained C# console app.

## 💡 Why We Do This

We want you to:
- Practice **starting fresh projects** like developers do in the real world
- Understand how to structure code, not just edit examples
- Develop **project-based thinking** (every lesson feeds a real task)
- Practice using the terminal and CLI — a core dev skill

## 🔁 Flow You Should Follow

1. **Finish the lesson** in the module
2. Go to the `projects/Project-1` folder
3. Read the `README.md` for the task
4. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
dotnet new console -o YourProjectName
cd YourProjectName
```

5. Write your code in `Program.cs`
6. Test it using:

```bash
dotnet run
```

7. Push your work to Git (commit regularly!)

## 🧠 Reminder

Each module focuses on a **different core area of C#**. Your project is where you prove you understand it.

So:
- Use data types after the Data Types lesson
- Use `if`, `else`, `switch` after the Conditionals lesson
- Create your own methods after the Methods module
- Start building like a real dev 🧑‍💻

Happy coding!
