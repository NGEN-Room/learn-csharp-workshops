# Project – Student Grade Tracker

## 🧠 Goal:
Create a class that stores a student's name and grade, using encapsulation to control grade updates.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Create a `Student` class with:
   - `Name` (public property)
   - `Grade` (private field with `get`/`set` that only allows 0–100)
2. In `Main`, create a few students and display their grades

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Prevent setting grades above 100 or below 0
- Add a method to display pass/fail based on the grade

## 🛠️ How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o StudentGrades
cd StudentGrades
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
