# Project – To-Do List Manager

## 🧠 Goal:
Build a console app where users can add, remove, and view tasks.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Create an empty `List<string>` to hold tasks
2. Allow users to:
   - Add a task
   - Remove a task by name or index
   - View all tasks
   - Exit

## 🧪 Example Output:
```
Commands: [add, remove, view, exit]
> add
Enter task:
> Walk the dog
Task added!
```

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Add input validation
- Use a loop to keep running until `exit` is typed
- Show task numbers for better tracking

---

## 🛠️ How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o ToDoList
cd ToDoList
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
