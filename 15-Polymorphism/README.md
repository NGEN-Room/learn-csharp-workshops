# Module 15: Polymorphism

In this module, you'll learn how polymorphism lets you treat different object types through a common interface or base class.

---

## üí° What You'll Learn
- What polymorphism means in C#
- How to use overridden methods in a consistent way
- The role of base class references and method overriding
- How polymorphism enables flexible, scalable code

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Examples

### Polymorphism in action
```csharp
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaks.");
    }
}

public class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Meow.");
    }
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Woof.");
    }
}
```

### Using polymorphism
```csharp
List<Animal> animals = new List<Animal> { new Dog(), new Cat() };

foreach (Animal a in animals)
{
    a.Speak();  // Each one calls its own version of Speak()
}
```

## üß† Key Concepts

- Polymorphism = ‚Äúmany forms‚Äù
- Base class references can point to derived class objects
- Overridden methods allow objects to behave differently, even when accessed generically
- Encourages reusable, decoupled code
