## ðŸŽ¯ Where to Next?

### ðŸ’¥ Jumping into Unity from Here

You're in a great spot to move into Unity game development. Why?

âœ… You already understand:
- C# syntax and structure
- Classes, methods, and logic
- Object-oriented principles (inheritance, polymorphism)
- Loops, conditionals, and arrays/lists
- Exception handling and LINQ (used in data-heavy Unity scripts)

### ðŸ§© Unity-Specific Concepts to Learn

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s different in Unity:
- Unity APIs: `MonoBehaviour`, `Start()`, `Update()`, etc.
- GameObject components and scene structure
- Physics, collisions, input
- The Unity Editor workflow

### ðŸš€ Suggested Unity Learning Path

1. **Install Unity Hub + Unity Engine**
2. **Start with Unity Learn** (https://learn.unity.com/)
3. **Try the "Create with Code" pathway** â€“ it aligns well with your current level
4. **Build a simple 2D game** like a platformer or clicker
5. **Apply your C# logic** to score systems, game mechanics, player movement
6. **Continue here** I have also built out a similar learning module here

## ðŸ›  Tips for Teaching or Running This Workshop

- Encourage students to use branches and `git push` after each module
- Ask them to submit projects via pull requests or links
- Run weekly check-ins and quizzes
- Assign bonus challenges for those who want to go further
