## üîß How to Use

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NGEN-Room/learn-csharp-workshops.git
cd learn-csharp-workshops
```

---

### 2. **Create Your Own Branch**
As this repo is a work in progress, all students **must create their own branch** and work from that:

```bash
git checkout -b your-name
```

For example:
```bash
git checkout -b piha
```

- All your work will be saved under your branch.
- Every time you're ready to back up or submit your work, run:

```bash
git push -u origin your-name
```

> (Replace `your-name` with your actual branch name)

After that first push, you only need to run this after saving and committing your work:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message here"
git push
```

---

### 3. **Pick a Workshop Folder**  
Each folder (e.g., `01-Environment`, `02-Hello-World`) contains:
- A `README.md` with your lesson
- A `quiz.md` with reflection questions
- A `/projects/` folder (if included) with coding challenges

---

### 4. **Run Your Code**
Make sure you have the .NET SDK installed:  
üëâ https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download

Then run your app:
```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

---

### 5. **Stay Up to Date**
New workshops are added regularly. To keep your branch up to date:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-name
git merge main
```
