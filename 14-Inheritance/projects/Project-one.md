# Project – Vehicle System

## 🧠 Goal:
Create a class system to represent vehicles using inheritance.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Create a base class `Vehicle` with:
   - `Make`, `Model`, `Drive()` method
2. Create two derived classes:
   - `Car` that overrides `Drive()` to say “Driving a car...”
   - `Bike` that overrides `Drive()` to say “Riding a bike...”
3. Create and call methods from each type in `Main`

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Add a `FuelType` to `Car` and `GearCount` to `Bike`
- Use a `List<Vehicle>` to store and loop through all vehicles

## 🛠️ How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o VehicleSystem
cd VehicleSystem
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
