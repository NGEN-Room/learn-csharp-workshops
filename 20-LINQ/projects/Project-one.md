# Project – LINQ Student Filter

## 🧠 Goal:
Use LINQ to filter and search a list of student objects.

## 🔧 Instructions:
1. Create a `Student` class with `Name`, `Age`, and `Grade`
2. Add several students to a list
3. Use LINQ to:
   - Get all students older than 15
   - Get students with grade above 80
   - Find the first student named "Piha"

## ✅ Bonus Challenge:
- Print the results cleanly with `foreach`
- Use `OrderByDescending()` on grades

## 🛠️ How To Start

Create a new console app:
```bash
dotnet new console -o LINQStudentFilter
cd LINQStudentFilter
```

Write your code in `Program.cs` and run:
```bash
dotnet run
